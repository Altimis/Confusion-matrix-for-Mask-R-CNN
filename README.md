# Confusion-matrix-for-Matterport-implementation-of-Mask-R-CNN

This repo contains a solution to extract the True Posives, False Positives and False Negative of each classe (including the Background Class) and plot the confusion matrix. The background class is being counted to cover the cases when the model miss (detect background instead of an actual object or detect an object instead of background)

Here is an example of plotting a confusion matrix for 11 classes and the background (BG)
